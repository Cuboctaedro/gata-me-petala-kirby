"Ioannis Kapodistrias - Routes in his History" is an exhibition organized by the Library of the Hellenic Parliament and the Municipality of Nauplion. It was held in Nauplion parallel with the main exhibition about Kapoditrias which was held at the Library. Most of the items were at the original exhibition and the one at Nauplion therefore consisted mostly of reproduction and informational material. As such it was an exhibition were graphics played a major role.

The exhibition design was done by [Spyros Nasainas](https://www.facebook.com/curio.gr/) who also determined the overall layout of the graphics. The exhibition occupied four rooms each one dedicated to a different historical period and using a different background color. Long panels containing the main text and background decorations were placed in all the rooms while the rest of the exhibition material was printed in smaller panels that were hanged in front of the backgrounds.
