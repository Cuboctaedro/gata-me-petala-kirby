Title: cement 2018

----

Text: Cement, known until recently only from the building industry is now used for special constructions and objects of art. The process of cement  making involves molds, pigments and a “hands-on approach” at every stage. Each creation is unique and its value lies in the difficulty of obtaining special colors but also in the spontaneous and experimental result. Each bubble gives a non-repeatable texture, shape and effect that stands between industrial objects and traditional architecture.
