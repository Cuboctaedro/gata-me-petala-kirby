Text: 

The Gata Me Petala workshop organizes seminars for the production of handmade jewelry. These seminars are aimed at amateur craftspeople who wish to express themselves creatively using metal and semiprecious stones. In our fully equipped workshop pupils are taught how to apply all the techniques of goldsmiths and silversmiths as well as being taught the basic methods of jewelry design. They also learn how to organize a small but complete workshop  in their own home where they will be able to create jewelry based on their own ideas.
